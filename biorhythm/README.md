Pseudo-Science: Biorhythm Calculator

===================

Data science is a serious occupation. Just like any other science, however,
it can also be used for spurious topics, such as calculating your biorhythm.

-------------------

The idea that our physical states follow a predetermined rhythm has been
around as long as mathematics. The basic concept of biorhythm is that a
regular sinusoid cycle accurately describes our physical, emotional and
intellectual states. Each of these three cycles has a different wavelength (w ):

* physical: w = 23 days
* emotional: w = 28 days
* intellectual: w = 33 days

The cycle is calculated with `sin (2 * pi * t / w)` , where t indicates the
number of days since birth. This idea was developed by German surgeon
Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19th century and was popularised in the United States
in the late 1970s. There is no scientific evidence of the validity of this
theory but it is an entertaining way to play with data.
